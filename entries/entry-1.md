##### Inspiration
During my last two and a half months in the Software Engineering Program, I have decided to learn MySQL, a database management system. While I have interacted with MySQL last summer during my LinkedIn internship, I want to take a deeper dive. Why though? Is it because that I want to choose something easy to learn? Well. Even though I have created web applications, but I could not store the user’s information without a database. This time, I want to learn to create a mobile app, particularly iOS app. MySQL will be my tool to store user’s information and go beyond just retrieving and manipulating the user’s input without storing it.
