# Week 1 - Choosing MySQL

### Inspiration
With two and a half months left in my Software Engineering Program, I have decided to learn MySQL. While I have interacted with MySQL last summer during my LinkedIn internship, I want to take a deeper dive. Why? Is it because that I want to choose something easy to learn? Well, the real answer is *No.* I have used MySQL mainly for web applications, and this time, I want to use MySQL for mobile apps. 

### MySQL? 
*My Sequel?* **NO!!!** It's **_My Ess Que Ell_** <br>
MySQL is a database management system and it is one of the most popular open source database. The data in MySQL is stored as tables with columns and rows, which is similar to spreadsheets. It is usually for websites and web applications, but I will be connecting MySQL to Swift. I want MySQL to store user's profile information and use that to create a personalized study plan. 

### Project Ideas
While it was difficult for me to choose a topic for independent study, it is even harder for me to think of what to make with MySQL. I decided to approach my classmates asking about what they want to study and what they want to create. Wanting to explore mobile apps, I decided to create an ultimate study app. Learning MySQL will provide me the skills to store user's information into a database and manipulate it. I decided to collaborate with a classmate who is studying Swift to create an iOS productivity app. [Here is my basic outline/plan for the app.](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1jVP6avRuHRjs74tW0UkRaqfO9g4v46KwGnVp8TTLzd4/edit?usp=sharing)

### Learning
While I spent the majority of the week deciding on my topic, thinking of a plan, and finding tutorials to follow, I learned how to utilize MySQL through the terminal.

Commands:

Start:
```sudo /usr/local/mysql/support-files/mysql.server start```

Stop:
```sudo /usr/local/mysql/support-files/mysql.server stop```

Restart:
```sudo /usr/local/mysql/support-files/mysql.server restart```

### Takeaways
1. **OMG, I think I need to find something like Codecademy!** While I have founded some tutorials to follow, each has their own sayings. It is difficult for me to follow one tutorial and goes to another to learn more about. **AND** I have to find code-along examples myself! Luckily, I have come across some [MySQL courses](https://www.udemy.com/topic/mysql/) to follow along! I will be exploring these courses and figure out the best way for me to learn!
2. **Be patience!** I can't stress enough how important patience is! At first, I was frustrated when I couldn't figure out how to use MySQL in my terminal. *Okay, yes, the magic is googling.* Through googling, I was able to find the commands of starting, stopping, and restarting MySQL in the terminal. All I had to do was **copy and paste!** *See how much time I've wasted being frustrated?* Anyways, the truth is that I didn't waste that much time because I went to googling immediately. **BUT** it is important to work *smarter*, not harder.
