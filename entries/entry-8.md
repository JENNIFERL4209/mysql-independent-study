# Week 8 - Life•X•Focus App Construction

### Inspiration
This week, I was notified that I am a finalist for the Software Engineering Program (SEP) Showcase. Therefore, I made a to-do list to make sure that I will complete everything before the showcase. 

### Learning
1. To-Do List
- [x] App Name
- [x] App Logo
- [x] Powerpoint 
- [x] Understand Swift Code for the App 
- [x] User Info Database
- [ ] Design App

2. __Life•X•Focus__ will be my productivity app's name where I used my last name's initial in __Life__, __X__ for my partner's name Xiurong, and __Focus__ is the app's main mission!

3. Below is my app logo that I created. <br> ![alt_text](https://github.com/JENNIFERL4209/mysql-independent-study/blob/master/images/AppLogo.jpeg)

4. After nine weeks, I need to present my app to my class and to the showcase audiences. Therefore, I organized a [powerpoint](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1LOUxn2ikI7NjMUE9wP5_fSEpsBgVItAgUtAMr1ohgsU/edit?usp=sharing) to present my independent study journey and my learning product: app.

5. I took some time to understand the code in my app. 
    * ```@IBOutlet weak var ____: UILabel!``` is a connector to a label (user_input) and UI is a user interface kit that contains labels and buttons.
    * ```performSegue(withIdentifier: " ", sender: self)``` is a "route" that performs a segway through a unique inspector.
    * I inserted comments in Xcode, a development environment for MacOS, but Xiurong doesn't want to reveal them. Swift is pretty self-explanatory and easy to understand.
 
6. Finally, Swift is able to pass data to Firebase. For more information, please review [Xiurong's blog](https://github.com/xiurongy3506/swift_independent_study/blob/master/entries/entry8.md).

7. Although I had a long weekend, I didn't have time to design my app yet. However, I have a general idea of what to do.
    * Use Google Fonts to find font styles
    * Use CocoaPods to import Google Fonts
    * App color will be blue and yellow based on our favorite colors
    * Provide feature recommendations such as using a minute timer instead of the second timer
      * Add & update to-do lists 

### Takeaways 
1. __Be proud of what you do.__ Because I am focusing on database management, I couldn't do much to help Xiurong in Swift. If she encounters a bug in Swift, I can't do anything because I didn't learn about Swift. I can only help her anything related to Firebase. I feel bad that Xiurong has to do the majority of the work. Therefore, I decided to take on app design to pull off Xiurong's weight. Regardless of what, I hope that I can still be proud of what I'm doing.
